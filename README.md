# Tewo Republic

## Problem
Farmers and sellers in Africa often have to rely on intermediaries (middlemen) to reach buyers, which results in reduced earnings for farmers and inflated prices for consumers. The current system also lacks transparency and security, making it harder to ensure fair transactions.

## Solution
At Tewo Republic, we’re making buying and selling farm easier and fairer for everyone involved. We’ve created an online platform where farmers and sellers can connect directly with buyers, using blockchain technology to keep things transparent and secure. By cutting out the middlemen, we help keep prices fair and put more money in the hands of those who grow and sell our food. We’re here to support our agricultural communities and bring fresh, affordable food to everyone.## Available Scripts
